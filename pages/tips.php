                        KNUST is located in Kumasi, the Garden City, in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. For persons within and around the Kumasi Metropolis, the first access point to Ghana's No.1 University is Tech. Junction, a major station just outside the main gate of the University. From any point in and around the metropolis, one can board any vehicle, be it private or commercial to Tech Junction. Outside Kumasi, knust-biochemistry-course-outline can get to KNUST by either driving to Kumasi or by boarding a Kumasi Bound bus and then locating Tech. Junction. From the Tech Junction, there are available options to enable you reach your destination on campus.

                    <p>
                        Getting to and around KNUST campus is an easy task for all. On arrival at Tech. Junction, which is a main transport terminal just outside the main gate of this prestigious University, one can locate several avenues to board a car to get to campus. First is by transport through any of our gates to campus in a private vehicle. Private vehicles are allowed into main KNUST campus without any restrictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second is by locating our officially embossed campus taxi cabs with stickers and transport shuttles which are the only commercial type of vehicles allowed into the main campus for security reasons.  Third is by walking directly to and through any part of campus if you choose that as an alternative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last is by boarding any commercial vehicle passing through campus to Ayeduase New site or Kotei environs or Kumasi market and alighting at Continental Roundabout. However, this options will require walking or boarding a campus registered commercial vehicle to enable you arrive at your desired destination. NB: Entry to main campus area by commercial vehicles are not allowed EXCEPT for KNUST shuttles and KNUST Registered and Embossed Taxis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transport fares from various cities, towns and villages differ taking into consideration the distance to Kumasi and the type of vehicle available. From Accra to Kumasi transport by bus, it costs between GHC 8.00 to GHC 30.00 with respect to mini buses, big and small Yutong Buses and VIP buses. You may check fares at various stations to know how much it costs to get to Kumasi from your current location. It cost 50Gp to join a shuttle or commercially registered KNUST embossed taxi from Tech. Junction to main campus. It costs 50/60Gp for a commercial bus from Tech. Junction to some parts of campus before continuing by other means to main campus. *However, chattered taxis have different fare charges depending on the location one boards the vehicle. NB: Transport fares for chattered vehicles may vary. Example, Campus to Kumasi Market or town may cost from GHC 3.00 to GHC 7.00 for registered campus taxis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Getting around campus is easy either by foot, taxi or shuttle services. You can follow the map provided to locate your way around campus. However, taxis use designated route which lead you to and fro various halls of residence on campus and to tech. Junction. Shuttles lead to and fro various halls of residence on campus and academic areas and also to commercial area of KNUST. However, shuttles occasionally go to and fro tech. junction when more services to transport to main campus are required.

                        There are Six Halls of residence and a number of hostels in the University. They are Queen Elizabeth II, Unity, Independence, Republic, University, and Africa. Three of the Halls of residence are mixed, two for males only and one for females only. Of the five hostels, two are for postgraduate students, one for both undergraduate and graduate students and managed by the Ghana Universities Staff Superannuation Scheme (GUSSS).

                    <p>
                        As part of the measures to improve the security of our Students, particularly International Students and to ensure the provision of an enabling residential facility and environment for their studies and stay, it is the policy of the University that, all International Students are to be accommodated on Campus in University's Halls of Residence, GUSSS, Hall Seven and SRC Hostels Facilities. It is therefore an offence for any International Student to lodge outside the designated places.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The University is unable to guarantee all students accommodation (especially continuing students). Most students are, therefore, living in private sector housing (hostels), most of which are located outside the University Campus. A majority of these hostels are however, within walking distances to the University Campus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       There is a wide range of private hostel accommodation for students of KNUST to consider in Kumasi. These range from hostels with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities to flats, those with the study bedrooms having their own private bathrooms and small kitchenettes. Some of the hostels even have air conditioners and internet connectivity in the study bedrooms. All of them are self-catering. Kumasi is a fantastic city to live in and living in your own accommodation away from the University will afford you the best opportunity to experience the vibrant and diverse nature of the city. However, private hostel accommodation is not easy to find and costs are considerably high in Kumasi.

                       More detailed information, including the list of private hostels, their locations, facilities and services, as well as rents, are available at the Students Housing and Residence life Unit at the Dean of Students Office.

                    <p>
                       There are three (3) Non-Resident facilities on Campus. One is located behind "Club B" (very close to College of Art and Social Sciences) while the other two are located at the main Faculty Area. All of them have reading rooms, bathrooms, and lockers where students can keep their books. Two of these facilities have entertainment/T.V. rooms, which are connected to a 24-hour Multi Choice DSTV Transmission.Ideally these facilities are meant to serve as learning and resting places for non-resident students during lunch breaks and their free periods while they are on Campus. Indeed, the facilities are highly patronized by non-resident students especially during examination periods when they operate 24 hour basis.

                    <p>
                        The University currently has six Halls of Residence. The GUSSS, Graduate Students, Credit Union and the SRC have a Hostel each on campus. Ghana Hostels Limited also has residential facility on campus. The three are managed differently from the main halls. A Hall Council consisting of Senior and Junior members administers each Hall. The Executive Head of the Hall is the Hall Master who is assisted by a Senior Tutor. There is also a Hall Bursar and other supporting staff. The Hall authorities determine the number of students in a room. The Hall authorities of the various Halls constitute the Committee of Hall Administrators who formulates common policies for all the Halls.

                        We believe that although studying is a major part of your life here on campus, there should be times to have fun and a cool head to reflect on good things and times of your life here on campus. Outside the classroom there are a number of activities students can engage in. Therefore KNUST has made arrangements so that your dedicated time for social life is also made very comfortable and full of enjoyment.

                        Students' social life on the campus is organized by the Junior Common Room Committees, which also act as liaison between the student body and the Hall authorities in their Halls. The Students' Representative Council (SRC), whose executive is appointed from campus-wide elections, is responsible for the co-ordination of the activities of the various Junior Common Room Committees. There are Faculty societies, which provide extra curricula activities for junior members of the particular Faculty.

                        Living on campus connects you to the full range of opportunities that KNUST has to offer. This is one reason why nearly all undergraduate students and more than 50 percent of graduate students live in halls   and hostels on campus.  KNUST   boasts of six traditional halls of residence.  The University Hall (KATANGA) and Unity Hall are all-male residential facilities.  Africa Hall is an all-female residential facility.  The three others namely Queen Elizabeth II, Independence and Republic Halls of residence are all mixed-sex halls.

                        A number of Private Hostels are available around the campus and in Kumasi for students who, as a result of the limited facilities/rooms could not be admitted as resident students. Currently, about 60% of the total student population is non-resident. There are also Non-Resident Facilities on campus (located near Club 'B' and the Central Classroom Block) where non-resident students could take a rest between lectures and do their own private studies before they leave for their various homes and hostels.
